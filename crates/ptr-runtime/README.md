### Implemented now

- Ordered semantic journal publication before acknowledgment or model resume
- Semantic payload/dependency/revision reconstruction with schema and transition validation during replay
- Complete typed Pod bytes and source identity are revision-significant
- Fallible ingestion, optimistic base revision and canonical no-op handling
- Scoped synchronous execution gateway with opaque per-runtime sessions, exact grants, frozen ActionIR permits and registered verifier/executor binding
- Consume-time freshness, expiry, ownership and mandatory permission checks; permissions/commit/effect epochs invalidate pending permits
- Executor or ledger ambiguity fences subsequent execution and commits; process-local single-use authority is never replayed
- Ledger-only lifecycle mutation; invalid/rewinding/tombstoned/cross-project transitions rejected before append and during replay
- Central runtime object wiring configuration, SemDB, ledger, materialized state, events and permissions
- Durable standalone runtime constructor opens/replays FileLedger and reconstructs lifecycle/materialized state across restart
- Text ingestion into revisioned semantic state
- Current-revision, live-generation/revocation and capability/effect checks for ActionIR delegated through typed ptr-security authorization decisions
- Committed-event materialization and runtime event emission
- Committed-event replay rebuilds lifecycle state and preserves revocation
- Reference InferenceBackend request loop runs against a revisioned ModelRequest and emits completion event
- Typed model→PodRegistry→Pod→Verifier→SemDB observation loop for Pure/Read cognitive Pods
- Bounded multi-step model resume loop after verified Pod observations advances semantic revision before continuation

### Missing for the target architecture

- Network-authenticated/scoped Pod integration and neural checkpoint admission
- Durable execution audit/idempotency, downstream fencing and real snapshot serialization
- Router-driven operator selection around the implemented bounded Pod-resume loop
- Async isolate scheduler integration
- Configured raft-engine/raft-rs/Turso backend composition for production runtime modes
- Streaming client response lifecycle and cancellation

### Next milestones

- Add authenticated framing/snapshots and checkpoint admission before persistent execution authority
- Connect evaluated raft-engine/Turso adapters through typed backend config while preserving FileLedger reference mode
- Add opaque backend checkpoint handles and async streaming around the implemented observation resume contract
- Wire ptrd request handling beyond bootstrap ingestion

## Mission

Keep orchestration out of `ptrd` and out of individual domain crates. The runtime coordinates transitions while each component retains ownership of its semantics.

## Current boundary

The executable reference slice now wires configuration, semantic revisioning, a backend-neutral model call, semantic Pod resolution, Pure/Read Pod execution, verifier-gated observation promotion, action authorization, event emission, ledger materialization and durable FileLedger reopen/replay. The new scoped synchronous execution gateway binds opaque sessions and immutable ActionIR permits to host-registered verifiers/executors. Administrative session registration assumes the embedding host has authenticated the principal; it is not an HTTP authentication endpoint. See [P0.1 execution authority](../../docs/architecture/21-scoped-execution.md) for guarantees, counterexamples and the remaining durable/network gates. P0.2 now reconstructs the actual journaled semantic payloads, dependencies and revisions. The next persistence gate is record integrity and verified snapshot/checkpoint admission, not additional backend breadth.

## P0.2 semantic journal integration

[Durable semantic-state contract](../../docs/architecture/22-durable-semantic-state.md)
records the new code/codec, ownership and replay boundaries. Publication follows
successful journal append. Typed Pod bytes and source identity participate in
semantic revisions. Logical removals do not erase log history; neural checkpoints
and authenticated framing remain separate gates. Execution evidence is in the PR.
