# M002-typed-attention

## Hypothesis
Do type/epistemic/validity biases improve constraint retention?

## Primary metrics
hard violations; calibration; latency

## Rule
Record matched baselines, hardware, seeds and negative results. Do not change success criteria after observing results.

## A0-internal ablation (research/falsification/A0-ablations-v1)

The `a0_*` entrypoints in `experiment.toml` run the A0 mechanism ablation study on
synthetic operator-routing v1: no-typed-attention (necessity given QK), the raw-blind manipulation check, and the blind-query pair (sufficiency). It is an A0-internal ablation on synthetic
data, **not** this manifest's baseline comparison. That comparison needs the plain
model baseline, which is not pinned yet (owner decision O2), so `status` stays
`planned` and `metrics.json` stays reserved for it; the study writes
`results/a0_internal_metrics.json` instead. Design, criteria and results:
`research/falsification/A0-ablations-v1/`.
