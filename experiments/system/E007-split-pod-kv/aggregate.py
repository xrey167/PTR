"""Aggregate the E007 seed runs into results/metrics.json and results/run.json.

Inputs are the run records `scripts/run_experiment.py run E007 --seed <s>` writes
(results/run-<timestamp>-seed-<s>.json): the newest record of every declared
seed whose command ran to an exit code. Nothing of the experiment is run again.
Every declared seed must have a record, the records must be of one
configuration and have run the checkout's code, this script included
(`experiment_records.source_revision`), and the preregistration digests of the
manifest, the table, the preregistration text and `criteria.toml` must be the
frozen ones.

The decision is mechanical, and it is `criteria.toml`'s (its header defines the
rule grammar, which `evaluate` below implements):

- a seed is judged by applying every coverage, falsifier and validity rule to
  the one JSON object its harness printed;
- validity first: a seed whose validity rule fails (a pin, the corpus
  selection, the procedure or the late replay window differs from the frozen
  run) is INVALID whatever else fired; its falsifier failures are listed as
  ignored, not counted, because the run did not follow the preregistered
  procedure;
- otherwise FALSIFIED if any falsifier fails in a readable record, even one
  that is INVALID for another reason (a dead control, a harness gap: a product
  defect is never turned into INVALID by those), or if a valid seed fails a
  coverage rule (the run is vacuous, which counts as falsified);
- INVALID otherwise when a seed cannot be judged: no result line, a harness
  that exited 2 or by a signal, another benchmark, seed, scale or experiment
  than the record's, harness gaps, a control that did not trip, a validity rule
  that fails (the record does not describe the frozen run), a rule whose counter
  is missing, null or of the wrong type, or an exit status that disagrees with
  the rules (0 with a failed rule, 1 with none). INVALID says nothing about the
  hypothesis;
- COMPLETED iff every seed holds every rule and the mutation evidence is
  complete. E007 is deterministic and has no sampled margin, so the outcome
  NOT_SHOWN of the repository's four does not arise.

The harness is shown able to fail by `results/mutations.json` (scripts/mutation_check.py E007), which must be this
experiment's evidence from the same code, checker and mutation plan with every mutation killed; a missing or partly
surviving record makes the verdict INVALID (the harness was not shown to see the defects it claims to see), never
COMPLETED. criteria.toml names no static evidence, so otherwise the verdict rests on the seeds alone.

metrics.json and run.json are published as one aggregate
(`experiment_records.publish_aggregate`). `--report PATH` also writes the
Markdown reading of the verdict to PATH (not into the results directory: a file
added there after the seeds ran would make the archived results stale).
